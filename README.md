# PythonFoundationNanodegree_BikeshareData
Python Project to perform analytics on the U.S. Bikeshare Datasets
This Python script has been created by Atul Nagendra Makam for Project 1 (Term 1) of Udacity's Python Foundation Nanodegree (PFND). 
It is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
It imports data from csv files and computes descriptive statistics from the data. 
It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
How to run the script:
You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE) such as PyCharm. 
This script is written in Python 3.
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017.
The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:
Start Time
End Time
Trip Duration (in seconds)
Start Station
End Station
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also contain the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year
The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:
What is the most popular month for start time?
What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
What is the most popular trip?
What are the counts of each user type?
What are the counts of gender?
What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?
